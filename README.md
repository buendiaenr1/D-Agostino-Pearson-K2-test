# D-Agostino-Pearson-K2-test
In statistics, D'Agostino's K2 test, named for Ralph D'Agostino, is a goodness-of-fit measure of departure from normality, that is the test aims to establish whether or not the given sample comes from a normally distributed population. The test is based on transformations of the sample kurtosis and skewness, and has power only against the alternatives that the distribution is skewed and/or kurtic.
